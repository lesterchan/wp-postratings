Tags: ratings, rating, postratings, postrating, vote, digg, ajax, post  
Requires at least: 4.2  
Tested up to: 4.7  
Stable tag: 1.84.1  

Adds an AJAX rating system for your WordPress site's content.

## Description

### Usage
1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/index.php`
2. You may place it in archive.php, single.php, post.php or page.php also.
3. Find: `<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>`
4. Add Anywhere Below It (The Place You Want The Ratings To Show): `<?php if(function_exists('the_ratings')) { the_ratings(); } ?>`

* If you DO NOT want the ratings to appear in every post/page, DO NOT use the code above. Just type in `[ratings]` into the selected post/page content and it will embed ratings into that post/page only.
* If you want to embed other post ratings use `[ratings id="1"]`, where 1 is the ID of the post/page ratings that you want to display.
* If you want to embed other post ratings results, use `[ratings id="1" results="true"]`, where 1 is the ID of the post/page ratings results that you want to display.
